/**
 * Re-derive Streamdown's default rehype pipeline so the app-internal `houhub`
 * scheme survives sanitization and reaches `MarkdownLink` → `ReferenceBadge`.
 *
 * Streamdown's default pipeline is `[raw, [rehypeSanitize, schema], harden]`
 * (run in that order). The sanitize schema's `protocols.href` allow-list omits
 * `houhub`, so it strips the href off our `[label](houhub://…)` reference links;
 * rehype-harden then sees a hrefless `<a>`, can't transform it, and replaces it
 * with a `… [blocked]` span — all at the rehype stage, *before* react-markdown
 * maps `<a>` to `MarkdownLink` (which turns a `houhub:` href into an inline
 * badge). The net effect was `@Codex CLI [blocked]` in the transcript.
 *
 * Adding `houhub` to the sanitize allow-list lets the href survive. harden is
 * left untouched: it already permits every protocol via its `*` default and
 * still hard-blocks `javascript:` / `data:` / `file:` / `vbscript:`, so widening
 * sanitize by one inert app scheme adds no XSS surface. `file://` links are
 * unaffected — they are rewritten to local paths at the remark layer (see
 * {@link "./remark-file-uri-links"}) before sanitize runs.
 *
 * Only the `sanitize` entry is rewritten; every other plugin is passed through
 * in its original position (mirroring how Streamdown builds the default list via
 * `Object.values`), so the pipeline stays correct if upstream adds plugins.
 * The two span attributes carry local-image references to the confined reader;
 * they never become browser image URLs or widen the src protocol allow-list.
 * Both spellings are listed on purpose: `remarkLocalImages` emits the dashed
 * attribute names, but sanitize matches against the *hast property* name, and
 * today that is the camelCased one only because Streamdown runs `rehype-raw`
 * ahead of sanitize (hast-util-raw serializes to HTML and re-parses, which
 * runs the names through property-information). Without `raw` in front the
 * dashed key reaches sanitize verbatim; allowing both keeps local images
 * working either way instead of silently degrading them to alt text.
